# Thronglets

A tiny artificial-life sandbox, inspired by the "Thronglets" from the Black
Mirror episode *Plaything* (S7E4) — little creatures that live inside a
simulation and end up with a language of their own.

This isn't a reproduction of anything from the show (that's fiction). It's a
real, if deliberately small, model of how a shared vocabulary can emerge from
**natural selection**, not machine learning:

- Each creature is born with a genome deciding which of 6 "tokens" (colors)
  it emits when it's **idle**, has **spotted food**, wants to **mate**,
  senses a nearby **predator**, or is **critically low on energy with no
  food in sight** — and separately, how it reacts on hearing each token
  from a neighbor (move toward it, away from it, or ignore it).
- Predators roam the world and kill any creature they catch. Spotting one
  puts a creature in a "danger" state, using the exact same signal/response
  machinery as food and mate calls — so an alarm call is just another word
  that can (or might not) emerge, not a special-cased mechanic. Each
  predator independently hunts whichever creature is nearest to it, and
  gently pushes away from other predators that get too close, so a pack
  doesn't collapse onto a single point when creatures cluster together.
- A creature whose energy drops critically low with no food visible enters
  **distress** - a fifth state, ranked below food (spotting actual food
  always wins) but above mating (survival first). It's not a special case
  either: same signal/response machinery, a color that may or may not come
  to mean anything to a creature's neighbors.
- Food and predators can each be **automatic** (food spawns in periodic
  patches; predators all appear at once) or **manual** (nothing spawns on
  its own — you place every food patch and every predator yourself). You
  pick which, once, at startup in all three renderers — it's not something
  you toggle mid-run.
- Nobody is told what a token should mean. Creatures whose signaling and
  listening genes happen to help them (and their offspring) find food or
  mates survive and reproduce more; genomes mutate a little at each birth.
- Over generations, population-wide agreement on "which token means food"
  and "which token means mate" climbs from chance level toward a real
  consensus — a small language being born purely from selection pressure.
- Signals also carry real information: a creature can *hear* a call from
  farther away than it can *see* food itself, so listening to others is
  genuinely useful, not just decorative.
- All three renderers have an in-game notice (`h`/`H` in pygame and the
  terminal, a "Notice" button on the web page) explaining the mechanics
  above without leaving the running simulation.
- The whole interface is available in English or French, chosen once at
  startup in pygame/terminal, or toggled anytime (even mid-run) with the
  buttons at the top of the web page — including the state names
  themselves (`food-call`/`nourriture`, `mate-call`/`partenaire`,
  `alarm-call`/`alerte`, `idle`/`inactif`).
- The running game — the actual population, with whatever language it has
  evolved on its own, not just the trained-AI vocabulary — can be saved and
  resumed later (`s`/`S` to save in the terminal/pygame, a "Save" button on
  the web page). If a save exists, every renderer offers to resume it right
  at startup, before asking anything else.

## Run it

There are three renderers, all sharing the same simulation core:

- `main.py` — a pygame window (nicer, needs a display + pygame installed).
- `main_tui.py` — a plain terminal renderer using only the standard library's
  `curses` module + numpy. No GUI, no pygame, no X server.
- `main_web.py` — a local web server (standard library only, no new
  dependency) with an HTML/canvas page you open in any browser. Works
  anywhere, including Termux.

### Desktop (pygame)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

The window opens fullscreen at the desktop's own resolution, stretching
the world to fill the screen exactly (no letterbox bars, whatever the
screen's aspect ratio) — `ESC` quits back to the desktop.

On launch you're asked to press `E`/`F` for English or French, `ENTER`
defaulting to French. If a save from a previous run exists
(`thronglets_save.json`), you're then asked whether to resume it — say yes
and everything else is skipped, you're straight back where you left off.
Otherwise you pick `A` (automatic) or `M` (manual), how many creatures to
start with (type a number, 1-220, `ENTER` to confirm or skip for the
default of 100), `Y`/`N` (`O`/`N` in French) for whether physical traits
(speed, vision, hearing, metabolism) evolve too — see
[Adaptive traits](#adaptive-traits-optional) below, off by default — then
`Y`/`N`/`T` (`O`/`N`/`T` in French) for whether to start already speaking a
pre-trained language, train a fresh one live right there, or skip it (see
below for both) — every screen defaults to French/automatic/100/no-traits/yes
if you just hit `ENTER` through all of them, and they stick for the whole run
(`R` resets using them again, it doesn't ask a second time).

| Key           | Effect                                                       |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `SPACE`       | pause / resume                                              |
| `UP` / `DOWN` | speed up / slow down the simulation                         |
| `R`           | reset to a fresh world (same mode, same predator count)      |
| `P`           | toggle what manual clicks place (food / predator)             |
| `[` / `]`     | remove / add a predator right now (also sets the reset count) |
| `S`           | save the running game to `thronglets_save.json`               |
| `G`           | vocabulary-over-time graph                                  |
| `T`           | family tree - browse ancestors/descendants                  |
| `H`           | in-game notice explaining the mechanics                      |
| left click    | place food (auto mode) or whatever's selected (manual mode)  |
| `ESC`         | quit                                                         |

### Termux (Android)

Getting pygame's SDL2 dependencies to compile on Termux is a known pain
(needs the X11 repo, clang, `sdl2-dev`, and a running Termux:X11 session —
see [this issue](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/6233) if
you want to fight that battle). It's not needed here: `main_tui.py` draws
the whole simulation with colored characters directly in your terminal.

```bash
pkg update
pkg install python
pip install numpy
git clone <this repo's URL>   # or copy the thronglets/ folder over
cd claudeai/thronglets
python main_tui.py
```

On launch you're asked to press `E`/`F` for English or French, `enter`
defaulting to French. If a save from a previous run exists, you're then
asked whether to resume it — say yes and the population, food, and
predators come back exactly as you left them, skipping every other
question. Otherwise: `A` (automatic) or `M` (manual), how many creatures to
start with (1-220, `enter` to confirm or skip for the default of 100), a
yes/no for whether physical traits evolve too (`y`/`n` in English, `o`/`n`
in French, off by default — see
[Adaptive traits](#adaptive-traits-optional) below), then a yes/no for
whether to start already speaking a pre-trained language (see below,
`y`/`n` in English, `o`/`n` in French) — every screen defaults to
French/automatic/100/no-traits/yes if you just hit `enter` through all of
them, and all choices stick for the whole run.

Creatures show up as a colored `o` (colored by whatever token they're
currently signaling, white if silent), food as green `.`, predators as a red
`X`. Controls: `space`=pause, `f`=drop a food patch (auto mode only),
`r`=reset, `+`/`-`=speed, `q`=quit, `p`=toggle food/predator placement,
`[`/`]`=remove/add a predator right now, `s`=save to `thronglets_save.json`,
`g`=vocabulary-over-time graph, `t`=family tree, `h`=in-game notice
(paginated so it fits any terminal height). There's no
reliable mouse support in a terminal, so manual mode uses a keyboard cursor
instead: the arrow keys move it, `enter` places whatever's currently
selected.
Works best in a wide/tall terminal — Termux's default font is fairly large,
so consider shrinking it (pinch to zoom, or Termux's font settings) to see
more of the world at once.

### Web (any device with a browser)

No new dependency at all beyond numpy — the server is built on Python's
standard `http.server`, and the page is a single self-contained HTML file
served from memory.

```bash
python main_web.py                  # defaults to port 8765
python main_web.py --port 9000      # or pick your own port
```

Then open `http://localhost:8765` (swap in your port) in any browser on the
same device. Two small buttons at the top switch the whole page between
English and French at any time, including mid-run (French by default) —
this one isn't a one-time choice like the others. The world doesn't exist
yet — if a save from a previous run exists, a **Resume saved game** button
appears on the start screen and skips every other question. Otherwise,
pick automatic or manual mode, how many creatures to start with (pre-filled
with 100), whether physical traits evolve too (unchecked by default — see
[Adaptive traits](#adaptive-traits-optional) below), and whether to
activate a pre-trained language (checked by default), and those four stick
for the whole run (Reset doesn't ask again). Once
started, the page polls the server a few times a second for a fresh
snapshot and draws it to a `<canvas>`; buttons
handle pause/reset/speed and what a manual placement adds. `+`/`- predateurs`
remove or add a predator immediately (also setting how many a reset will
use), tapping/clicking the world places food (auto mode) or whatever's
selected (manual mode), a **Save** button writes the running game to
`thronglets_save.json`, a **Family** button opens the genealogy browser
(arrow keys or on-screen ▲▼◀▶ buttons to navigate), and a **Notice** button
opens an explainer of the mechanics without pausing the simulation
underneath.

All three renderers show a HUD with, for each internal state (danger / food-call /
distress-call / mate-call / idle), every token currently in use and what share
of the living population uses it — the numbers to watch are how fast a single
token pulls ahead of the pack (starting near chance, ~17%, since there are 6
tokens) and whether it stays there.

A separate **Graph** screen (`g`/`G` in pygame and the terminal, a "Graph"
button on the web page — the same pattern as the in-game notice) plots each
state's dominant-token share over time as a proper curve: a sample every 20
ticks, the last 200 kept. A rising line is a color pulling ahead, a falling
one is a consensus breaking apart, a flat line at the bottom is no agreement
yet. This history rides along with `s`/save (so a resumed game keeps its
curve, not just its population) but resets on `r`/reset, same as everything
else about the world.

Speed is measured in real time, not rendered frames: the default `x1` is a
genuine one tick per second, slow enough to actually watch a single decision
happen, and `x10`/`x50`/etc. scale from that same one-second baseline
(capped at `x200`) rather than from whatever frame rate the renderer happens
to draw at.

Every creature is tracked back to its parent(s) - a **Family** screen
(`t`/`T` in pygame and the terminal, a "Family" button on the web page, same
pattern as the Graph/Notice screens) is an ego-centric genealogy browser
rather than one giant tree crammed onto a screen: it shows one creature at a
time - its generation number, whether it's alive or when it died, its
parent(s), its children, and how many total descendants it has (and how many
of those are still alive) - and the arrow keys walk the tree from there (up
to a parent, down to a first child, left/right between siblings). Since
mating just picks the nearest eligible neighbor with no notion of family,
it's entirely possible - and something you may actually run into - for a
creature to end up mating with its own descendant; the browser doesn't hide
this, a lineage isn't a strict tree. Opening it doesn't reset or pause
anything (the web version even keeps ticking live behind it); unlike
Graph/Notice, which dismiss on any key, `t`/`ESC` close this one specifically
since the arrow keys are busy navigating.

## Adaptive traits (optional)

By default every creature has the same fixed speed, vision range, hearing
range, and metabolism — only signaling and listening evolve. Turning on
**"Adaptive evolution"** at startup (asked right after population size, in
all three renderers — off by default, since it changes the balance of the
simulation) makes those four physical traits part of the genome too:
inherited from parents, mutated a little at each birth, and bounded within a
sane range. A faster, sharper-sensed creature isn't a free upgrade, though —
speed, vision, and hearing each add to that individual's energy cost per
tick, so a genome that maxes everything out just starves faster. Selection
has to actually weigh "can sense more of the world" against "burns energy
faster doing it," the same kind of real trade-off that already exists
between signaling and staying silent.

## Headless check

`simulation.py` has no pygame dependency, so the core can be run and tested
without a display:

```bash
python test_smoke.py
```

This runs several thousand ticks and asserts the population survives and
vocabulary agreement increases — i.e. that a language is actually emerging,
not just that the window doesn't crash.

## Where to take it next

The simulation core (`simulation.py`) and renderer (`main.py`) are split on
purpose so this is easy to extend:

- A "translator" panel logging the emerging token → meaning dictionary over time
- Swapping the fixed 2D field for a proper toroidal world, or a richer
  pixel-art renderer for the creatures themselves
- Feeding `train_language.py`'s per-agent diversity back in - it currently
  trains one shared Speaker/Listener pair (a "population" that's forced to
  agree with itself by construction); training several pairs with random
  pairing per episode would be a fairer comparison to the evolved version's
  actual population diversity

## The gradient-trained version: `train_language.py`

`simulation.py`'s colors emerge from blind evolutionary drift - nothing in
that model is actually optimizing for successful communication, only
surviving long enough to reproduce. `train_language.py` is a separate,
optional experiment that trains a real Speaker and Listener network with
backpropagation (Gumbel-Softmax for a differentiable discrete channel) to
directly minimize communication error, using the same 5-state/6-token
vocabulary for a fair comparison. It needs PyTorch:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-rl.txt
python train_language.py            # one run, with training progress printed
python train_language.py --sweep 10 # 10 independent seeds, collision-rate summary
```

This needs a genuinely heavy dependency not expected to work on Termux -
unlike the three renderers, it's a standalone script, and doesn't touch
`simulation.py` or the real-time game.

Training starts from scratch and forgets everything the moment the process
ends, unless you save it: a normal run automatically writes the trained
Speaker/Listener to `language_model.pt` (customize with `--checkpoint`).
To look at what a past run learned without retraining:

```bash
python train_language.py --load
```

**What actually happened when we ran it**, sampling states with the same
idle-heavy skew the real simulation has: 4 out of 10 seeds converged to a
perfect, collision-free code (100% listener accuracy) - a real difference
from the evolved version, where two states landing on the same color is
common and can persist indefinitely. But it's a tighter squeeze than it
looks: 5 states now have to fit into 6 tokens (only one spare, instead of
two), so it's less forgiving than the original 4-state setup. The 6 seeds
that still collided always merged two of the three *rarest* states
(`distress-call`, `alarm-call`, `mate-call`, each well under 15% of
samples) into one token, never touching `food-call` or `idle`, and capped
accuracy around 80%. With `--uniform` (equal frequency for all 5 states)
instead, it's clean almost every time (9/10 in our sweep) - much better
than the skewed case, but no longer the literal 100% guarantee it was with
4 states: fitting 5 states into 6 tokens leaves only one token of slack
even without a frequency skew working against it.

So gradient descent doesn't magically solve the underlying issue, it just
attacks it far more directly and far more often: with a skewed class
distribution, the loss saved by correctly separating a rare class from
another rare class is tiny next to the loss from the frequent classes, so
occasionally the network settles for merging them anyway - a cleaner,
quantifiable version of the exact same "the frequent state drowns out the
rare one" dynamic behind the evolved version's homonymy, not an escape
from it.

## Feeding the trained language into the real game

`train_language.py` always finishes by writing `language_model.json` (see
`--export`) - a tiny, PyTorch-free lookup table (which token each state
maps to, and vice versa) baked out of the trained networks. All three
renderers can start a population already speaking that clean vocabulary,
with `--language`:

```bash
python main.py            --language language_model.json
python main_tui.py        --language language_model.json
python main_web.py        --language language_model.json
```

You don't have to remember that flag, though: if you launch any renderer
without `--language`, right after picking the mode and the starting
population you're asked "Activer le langage pre-entraine par IA ?" (`O`/`N`
in pygame and the terminal, a checkbox on the web start screen) - answering
yes loads `language_model.json` from the current folder automatically. If
that file doesn't exist yet (you haven't run `train_language.py` there),
you get a clear message and the game starts normally instead of crashing.

Every creature in generation 0 gets an exact copy of the trained genome
(a spiked emission for its trained token per state, and response weights
that approach food/mate tokens and flee the danger token) - no PyTorch is
imported by the game itself, only the small JSON file is read. The header
shows a `[trained vocabulary]` tag so it's obvious the population didn't
start from scratch. Ordinary mutation and reproduction still apply from
tick 1 onward, so this seeds the starting point, it doesn't freeze the
language in place.

### Training live, from inside `main.py`

You don't have to leave the game or touch a terminal to train one: on the
AI-language screen, press `T` instead of `Y`/`N` to train a fresh seed
right there. This is the same `train()` used by `train_language.py --sweep`,
just called directly - `main.py` imports `train_language` lazily, only when
you press `T`, so nothing else in the game needs PyTorch installed. This
still needs `pip install -r requirements-rl.txt` to work; if it isn't
installed, pressing `T` gives a clear message and the game starts without
AI instead of crashing, same as a missing `language_model.json`.

Training one seed shows live progress (step, loss, listener accuracy)
right in the window - it takes a little while (the same few thousand
training steps `--sweep` runs per seed), `ESC` cancels it early. Once a
seed finishes, its result is shown - clean or collision, overall accuracy,
and the color each state landed on - and you choose:

| Key   | Effect                                                          |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `V`   | use this seed - exports it to `language_model.json` and starts the game with it |
| `N`   | keep this one's result, try the next seed instead                |
| `ESC` | give up - start the game without AI                              |

This is the interactive version of watching `--sweep`'s collision-rate
table scroll by and then re-running with `--seed` on whichever one looked
good, except you never leave the game window and don't need to remember a
seed number - you just watch each one train and decide as you go.

**Does the clean vocabulary survive being handed to blind evolution?**
Running seeded worlds for 20,000 ticks shows agreement on all five states
staying at or extremely close to 100% the entire way, for as long as the
population survives - once selection has nothing left to gain from
reshuffling an already-optimal, collision-free code, there's essentially
no pressure pushing it away from that optimum. Population itself can still
boom and crash from ordinary resource pressure (the food supply is fixed
regardless of headcount) independently of how clean the vocabulary is -
the same extinction risk that was always possible in this simulation, not
something the trained vocabulary introduces: in a 5-seed spot-check, 1 run
died out this way around tick 2700 after a population boom outran the food
supply, the other 4 held a clean vocabulary the whole time they were alive.

## A known quirk: homonyms

Each state's dominant token is decided independently, so nothing stops two
different states from converging on the *same* color by chance — a listener
who hears that color can't tell which meaning was intended. Since `idle` is
by far the most common state, this is usually what "wins" any collision,
drowning out the rarer, more useful signal in noise. With 5 states sharing
6 tokens (only one spare instead of two), there's less room to avoid
collisions than before `distress-call` existed.

There's a per-signal energy cost (`SIGNAL_COST` in `simulation.py`) that
makes needless "idle chatter" costly, which helps but doesn't guarantee a
clean vocabulary — across seeds it still sometimes lets two states share a
token. A stronger, more targeted fix (explicitly penalizing a genome when
two of its states share a dominant token) was considered and deliberately
left out, to keep the outcome driven by selection rather than a rule
designed to force a specific result. In practice the collision does
sometimes resolve itself over further generations - and sometimes doesn't.

## Honest caveat

This was built in a container without a display. The mechanics are verified
via `test_smoke.py` (population survives, vocabulary converges across
multiple random seeds); `main_tui.py`'s startup prompt, placing toggle,
cursor movement, manual placement, and the paginated in-game notice were
all driven end to end inside a real pseudo-terminal (read back through a
VT100 emulator) — including on a genuinely small 24-row terminal, which is
what caught the notice screen needing pagination in the first place (it
silently ran off the bottom of a normal-sized terminal otherwise), and
`main_web.py`'s start screen, placing, predator count, click-to-place, and
notice modal were all confirmed working end to end in a real headless
browser. `main.py`'s pygame window was exercised headlessly (SDL's dummy
driver) to confirm the new logic doesn't crash, but hasn't been eyeballed
live — worth a quick visual check the first time you run it locally.
